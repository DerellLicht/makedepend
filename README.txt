Modified by Derell Licht, circa 2005 or so.
The only changes that I made (I think) were in the Makefile, 
to get it to build under modern gcc.

This source code was obtained from whatever version of Linux 
that I was using at that time; I no longer recall any details,
but I've used this makedepend on all makefiles that I have
created ever since!!
